v1

Based off the 1970's board game. A computer randomizes a "key" 4 colored marbles in 4 set positions, translated into 4 numbers in a sequence.

The human player has 12 chances to guess the sequence, with each guess the player gets feedback, a colored_peg if a guess is the right number in the right position or a white_peg for every unique instance of a number existing in the key but is in the wrong position.
